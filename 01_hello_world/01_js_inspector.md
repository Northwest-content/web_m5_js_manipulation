**01_Hello_World**

> Finally we reach the most used programming language worldwide. 
We present to you 🥁🥁🥁

**❓ Question:**

> What will JavaScript add to our website? 

**🤓 Answer:** 

> JavaScript will let our websites dynamic in a way that interacts with the user's choices. 

**But first** Let’s learn `JavaScript` in a new place to get used to it, before going to `VS code`, we will be implementing it in the browsers inspector. 

**01_JS_Inspector**

Let's open the `Chrome Inspector`:

To `clear` out the place you can press on:

Which is this button:

**01_Prinint_Hello_World**

You will be asking “ Why Hello World?”, it is commonly known among beginners in programming that once starting a programming language to print `Hello World`.

**Implementation**

You will be writing: 

`console.log(“Hello World!”);`

Where `JavaScript` is telling the `console` in the inspector to print `Hello World!` .Try it 😍

Try printing any other thing

**02_Variables**

Variables are the elements that we assign them a value of our choice, values can be:

- String which a sentence 

- Numbers 

  And more will come in the future sections. 


![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0L12wy_aBQ3WU_lWJIjpkPF_5EkpPH2MDjdGhvKMJ_XI2U3acCfCWsXj5nvg8nbOHDZln23WdpakJ0RRRluxpp3AG2Xd7mU_Qv2gkni9T-pvoC0NgPQKauj71qo48mkg_abhPjZD)

Where `JavaScript` is saying, let a variable name = the variable value. Lets try to implement it 🤔

**Implementation**

- String

  Let's try to name a variable welcomer and assign it “Welcome!” the same way: 

  ```let welcomer = "Welcome"```

![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hhJpLFqF6B77XaNtZYCdjBwxZV2oJjypJIgVzzHc0BF-tnmdsjzse0NGR5-57ALFjEBeSie7x2v5DEG4lyln_KxtA49o37PIso14NvbkfGuNEGI_uppwMGIzBZiFLw46175Ot9qB)

**Note 📝:**

> Notice how we must use the `” ”` quotations before and after, so that `JavaScript` knows its a `String`

> Another thing to notice is `undefined` 🤔, BUT try typing `welcomer` alone now: 


![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/p7S9jmRlQqIRCJu35wlhSt6c2QGz8VjcTpyJRxoBabaaodTA73NRBSA8B2KhdEMK61q3ebH8-tQ-IwrUcgvILDRqIw3xjo9lmjxSfGIX1wC9ZPp788yAQ5qWqjhX5EMbu00-4a-r)

IT KNOWS IT 😍, the thing we did is creating a variable and reserved the name `welcomer` to be equal the value `Welcome`. 🔥

- Number

  Let's do the same with numbers, name a variable `number1` and giving it The value `3` as a random example. 


![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6SshDXJkTPaCJXCcvGtvE7nkPn02dfzocnLE5V_8jK0Js3NyRKV_LT-7_kMlO1MqNtsuWQClgM99m0bZ2jUmMqgI1NuZVuBlBLsjyr_ClwvnQWlQOQXXcgLwg2DAt5Zmhac3AUxe)

Variables are very useful:

- Where we can recall a value when needed\
- Values can be changed easily, like this:


![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/V4CSx_8mVpYDVfGpKYld9wzv3hSqXmPcH5M36VNVKj9eko-bj9ZfE-KBsmMLnBBj1YPTpopZ20yf8a-13IWXuVfdIrmLvLihaHba6eaOSBpIwNpdPbd9o3GfTqtsi175G5ws95Tg)

**Note 📝:**

> Notice that we did not need to use `let` when we changed the value of `number1` 
>
> Since they are reusable, we can do this too: 😍


![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/pR0xnH2O_KWdzYL6460EEJ8IoyQikC5FbF6LXR2QW2Eui4IZjQ0WjaY9VCUE1wqBL1daWujM8Sm86YlN0mp70WU9HSPPASxLF4yCjmV_9_0XD6wKCQTm_82ofivTkXSoWsE_3Btm)

**Note 📝:**

>  It is always good to name your variables with meaningful names.

**03_Operations**

Now that you future programmers are aware of what is a variable, IT'S TIME TO PLAY 😎We will be learning some operations that we can do on variables:

- Mathematical operations
- Logical operations 

*Mathematical Operations:*

Let's start easy on you future programs 😉, they are the well known ones:

1. Addition

   This is normal, let us assign a variable `5+2` to see.

![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2ANdtHHaA7RL47ugd7ViU5O03bkEJcftn1SGxdxz3hYLowoVQ5RcobI-PWJCNPlUR90U0r0GnCvkGLUEAtJLu4oKDsTPhdiydu40wQwlrA2Sop4uiMu8REKAsQVpXflc2OeVpPCW)

   `let x = 5+2`

   

`x` will now equal the summation of these variables. How about now we have variable `y` that has the value `1`: 


![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MIyTV0MxJ41vQFbHGdVNxmt2NKMj9jRiDJdye1E-Z0bCTw6bvsGIslALewmuvE0AGhgkua29S42Q3n0osWkjRaJNcfI_V4E12xrg9jw5tBKlSeuGVkKpNG-ELm-8YYEggrAuRJJt)

So now `x+y` must equal `8`, and to save this value as we learnt we should put it in a variable so `z = x+y`: 


![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/leHGeYG8gMdFWw6YvocPOfrY7-P-s99wF45o6exjGsjAewmPqfBiwPCuhLPjnaLjieE2thpf8dXoiZOi1EEpZqcpvNAZ5Eh-0QryLSeLxrCfV-bX59Bh0PfStJCJzQWcjOcNLwPs)

2. Subtraction 

   Same as the addition, let's do the following:

   - Have `x = 10`

   - ```
     z = x - y
     ```

   - ```
     y = 5
     ```


![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gvUsmoW7cJ8S-_5Z9xvv17Ak6cgOYNDMng2z-f-D1LGKUvYhNA0vK3n3zGhoG9WIj_utWbxnyaCqqWqHbfl_wuauY-in019BUZML3DZjM3qns6jWLAY-WPeuDeJe2MVc3NvDgiyf)

3. Multiplication 

   As you know `x` is a letter so programming languages do not see it the same way as mathematicians do. Instead of that we use `*` in all programming languages once you write `*` they will know it is a multiplication. Implementation TIME: 

   `x = 2*2`:

![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MnCJr9kLbVfHNdFkDGy8Hn7yvydeIImMiF0-TitksISWkdQuPFcQZzNrHhf1Pn2pB_syP-XYD9NTA-mFr0nd7Ibvpolg8A7KnjjWYtbsDyEo0sQ7e2cF4XV_PIlJ_K7TTA1H1ePz)

   

4. Division

   I guess you are thinking how do we have division? 🤔

![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Xl84z8kyXTgZfQM0e8p786ZIYCPE6FjNOFYbyzy4XKSeyDNO9O9HmyVq-8-Mr-mHOvoxP4KJmGALpnzL846hn7QJF4x_kJ0znTC1s5OIYbmYUUVMICuBIoaL4bDYqsswHuH-ZO-Y)

We got our self a missing math symbol 😅. DO NOT Worry! We do not use that symbol anyways in the programming field. We got you covered with using `/`, it might have different places on the keyboard depending on the language and the operating system.

**Implementation TIME**!!! 😍:

- ```
  x = 5
  ```

- ```
  y = 25
  ```

- ```
  z = x/y
  ```

  

5. Modulus ( new member in the math 😜)

   

*Logical Operations:* 

This is the new part to you, it will be easy ✨. Logical operations are the ones that are either true or false, never something else. You might recognize the following: 


![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6vj-KmYWqoQSSP13kTJC17AHyM96OvEHgYs1TrwHVIphbjUaDP9dsGAVtIe6IiKJzrcIgOh03grfTUafx5kiEgCuF_hdoYCkhKuYo2QODkGoh89vYKV7ynyTx2s8yL3PRptJzVB4)

These are your math friends, sadly not all can be written on the keyboard. As you know, we have our tricks to use them 😎

**Note 📝:**

> Notice how in the `less than or equal` and in the `greater than or equal`the `=` is alway on the right. It is also shown in the `==` and the `!=` 

**❓ Question:** 

> What is the difference between ``==` and `=`?

**🤓 Answer:**

> Having one `=` means you are saying put the value on the right inside the variable on the left, which is assigning a variable with a value. On the other hand, `==` is comparing if the left value equals the right value. ✨

**Implementation Time** 😍:

First to start comparing, lets implement some variables: 

- ```
  let x = 5
  ```

- ```
  let y = 4
  ```

And we will save out results in a variable called `result`:

1. `x > y` is x greater than y?

![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/E6h9Zb9EUBEgwRgkQ_EKAG6g7AMT_YmTANOc9nFXpfsACizv9eykcXyBLzWLYMY8-JFnDH9kgtmUpWBEHL_nlrPclutRaoa_KwxqXDOwptz1HWgA6JUUdSnjBsxu01wOZ-UU3zGQ)

2. `x >= y` is x greater than or equal y?

![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/O0XvhN3GbtVJdOufeYCax5J2zkowhtzThEmlN5Gkz6ICOIsQpYRjrJERJpHyqqHhRvrn4_XFLz84epgKuqX4m0-ugCK9MI9dptaPL30jzzHikUiv8mh2bCjRD8OJaaeXuelQh6cG)

3. `x<y` is y greater than x?

![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9wnVLtaqyoeNzbtcbrH6-c8taUdTXseBECtYthhmxmBsVzAAAF7npDMNxVWTjgbIdLH53tewU2jv-8RI1C1bOoh62FlxD8Z4LmQJk-0hKrFW0ppNQYRGlAyoShxCIE4t0XZB2Jru)

4. `x<=y` is y greater than or equal x?

![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tiqTkVIABFlHx83PfDGR2bDH0eeL3p8-cl-4-gTIE3NqDKMiiINh1Ka-A1bbxW_VP6nc16blZxFk1qGIzMYWwuXI6jqd25FbQbcUjpkNV3ZBYMqrMpV_eQ81ZSNbFzujO8CGgccQ)

5. `x == y` are x and y equal to each other?

![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p5C9l_G7NMJHvhBvG4Zf7Edttq5RXVfq4bhBGvXj3YKw5eL1CN_ztpFgjQnQTbOLhw9YSF8qt9EKZORteMK2eIZvXGEY16rzWKQUBC_kwkZAN2izWs9Cpikv8KoB3RO3oK7SfloZ)

6. `x != y` are x and y not equal to each other? 

![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZOhaYk8Y4V_ygVq0wmTuwFMsZW20ykctX19zDlEK3n6UJ_LCkbxsD0vYz1-eHFk7ZwcHcHGHS2THe-dC4cx-hRuM5pfqcakkUWB1eBCaJgNBnknhJjPd4Z-ZHsHp6HNi0oFD9kWn)

**Note 📝:**

> When a variable is either `true` or `false` it is called a boolean variable. So now you know numbers, strings and boolean 😎
