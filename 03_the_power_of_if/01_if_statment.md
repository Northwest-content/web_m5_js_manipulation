For sure you heard about the `if statements` from English grammar before, but now it came back different and easier and only logic will be included. üòéüî•

In our programming world we must understand that computers only understand logic, they do not know common sense üëÄ

That why `if statements` will only work if the condition is true, and it will look like this:

**Note üìù:**

> As we can see, the blue color is `FIXED` where the orange is our condition. Condition can either be `true` or `false`. If our condition is true it will apply anything written between the brackets. Other then that it will ignore the if statement 

**Note üìù:**

> Notice the comments are written differently in `JavaScript`, do not forget our short cut to convert code into comments `ctrl + /` or `command + /` üòâ

**Implementation:** 

Lets print `it was true` to check our if statement by implementing this code:

`````javascript
<script>
let number = 5;
if (number == 5) {
console.log("it is true, number = 5");
  }
</script>
`````

The above code will do the following:

1. Assigns `x` with the value `5`
2. Reads the `if statement` condition 
3. If the condition was true it will print `it is true, number = 5`
4. Other then that it will print nothing

So what do you think will happen? ü§î

YES it did print the sentence

Let's try to change `x` to see if it will not print?

It did not print it. LOGIC IS AMAZING üòç
